//Write an algorithm in C# such that the algorithm shall:
//1.  Iterate over the integers beginning with 1 and ending with 100
//2.  Print our each number in order
//3.  If the integer is an even multiple of 3 print "fizz" instead of the number
//4.  If the integer is an even multiple of 5 print "buzz" instead of the number
//5.  If the integer is an even multiple of both 3 and 5 print "fizz-buzz" instead of the number
